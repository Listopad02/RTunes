This is a media player with 3 pages for video, music and radio.<br/>
There're 5 JS files in project: 3 files for every page (videoPlayer.js, musicPlayer.js, radioPlayer.js), 1 file for a little sup. script (supScript.js) and the last file (index.js) for imports and function calls. Everthing is realized on pure JS.<br/>
<b>Unfortunately</b>, video player won't work for you, because my file <b>rocket_launching.mp4</b> is too large so i can't put it in folder "video" on GitHub, but you can put your own file (but don't forget to name it correctly)
