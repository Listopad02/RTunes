This is a media player with 3 pages for video, music and radio.<br/>
There're 5 JS files in project: 3 files for every page (videoPlayer.js, musicPlayer.js, radioPlayer.js), 1 file for a little sup. script (supScript.js) and the last file (index.js) for imports and function calls. Everthing is realized on pure JS.
